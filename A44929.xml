            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Thou art to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what <hi>entertainment</hi> thou must
<pb facs="tcp:61760:4"/> look for; and must be cumbred with <hi>Apologies</hi> for the meanness of it; with importunities for thy <hi>Pardon</hi> also, grounded either on the <hi>surprisal</hi> of thine <hi>Host,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his <hi>want</hi> of <hi>leasure</hi> to get fit <hi>accomodations</hi> for such a <hi>Guest,</hi> or (may be) the <hi>lowness</hi> of his <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi> which incapacitates him thereto, if nothing else had failed him. What's to come next then, but to tell thee, if his <hi>Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> be considered duly, <hi>Ovid</hi>'s old Plea may be honestly his,
<q>
                  <l>Haec quó{que} quae facio judex mirabitur aequus,</l>
                  <l>Scriptá{que} cum veniâ qualiacun{que} leget?</l>
               </q> But then an ugly <hi>difficulty</hi> is to be anticipated too. For why would you undertake a <hi>burden</hi> too heavy for your <hi>back? Magis nullius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb facs="tcp:61760:4"/> quam tuâ, non imponi cervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus tuis onus sub quo concidas,</hi> as he in <hi>Livy</hi> said to one of near affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to him. You might have been at quiet, an if you pleas'd your self. Now, what a work is here! It runs to a very riot instantly. The poor <hi>Pen</hi> bleeds many a <hi>drop,</hi> and the poorer <hi>Paper</hi>'s <hi>stab'd</hi> so that its <hi>Wounds</hi> are <hi>gangreen'd;</hi> and which is worse than either, the <hi>Readers patience</hi> is horribly <hi>martyr'd,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one <hi>word of reason</hi> comes to the rescue.</p>
            <p>For my part therefore, who am not such a <hi>Fool,</hi> to make a <hi>Wreck</hi> that I may get a <hi>Plank</hi> perhaps; and have more <hi>honesty</hi> than to baulk <hi>plain dealing,</hi> because <hi>dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> is so much in fashion; I must avoid all <hi>trifling Rhapsodies</hi> of that
<pb facs="tcp:61760:5"/> kind, and bluntly with few words declare, <hi>It is my judgment, that in a dreadful Fire of some Town or City, every man is bound to bestir himself in bringing of his Bucket for the quenching it; and he that can't do that, must turn the Cocks, or dam the Waters, or some other way do what he can, to prevent the total ruine of the place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is not a <hi>Riddle</hi> that needs an <hi>Oedipus</hi> for the solving of it. For whether <hi>Popery</hi> be not like a <hi>prevailing Flame</hi> in the very Heart and Bowels of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and menacing so much the greater <hi>mischief</hi> to us, as the <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> whereon it sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth, are infinitely better than those of <hi>Earth,</hi> and our <hi>Souls</hi> at an equal rate above our <hi>Bodies,</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:61760:5"/> appeal unto the many <hi>Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,</hi> and <hi>Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> lately passed against the same; indeed, to the <hi>Universal Sense</hi> of all <hi>Protestant Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether <hi>Judaism, Turcism,</hi> or <hi>Paganism</hi> hath a more mortal Influence on the Embracers of them, is not here to be determin'd; and the Reader, on perusal of this Treatise, will be better fitted for a judgment. But that the Romish Doctrines, with those Practices that flow naturally thence, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive utterly of <hi>Eternal Safety,</hi> is past all peradventure with all <hi>through-pac'd Protestants:</hi> and 'tis presum'd that the <hi>Discourse</hi> before us abounds with <hi>Reason,</hi> enough and over, to draw every <hi>honest Mind,</hi> though <hi>wavering</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61760:6"/> yet, to the same perswasion.</p>
            <p>If any think there is <hi>already</hi> a sufficient <hi>Stock</hi> upon this <hi>Subject,</hi> I will not say he is mistaken: though I conclude the while, That is no bar at all to this new attempt. <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>learnedst</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> said,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:61760:7"/> of <hi>silencing Scolds:</hi> but whether this <hi>Endeavour</hi> doth not force their <hi>own hands</hi> to lay a <hi>Padlock</hi> upon their <hi>own Lips,</hi> so that they can never open more, without first <hi>crying shame upon themselves,</hi> is left to those to judg that will be at the pains of <hi>hearing fairly.</hi>

Which, as it doth insinuate an aptness in the noblest Creatures to degenerate, so it pronounceth such degeneracy (especially when 'tis ripened to its height) to be of vilest Nature, and most pernicious Consequence. And should we give our Thoughts that little trouble, only of glancing on the River
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61760:13"/>
                  <hi>Nilus,</hi> abundant proof will lie before us. We have therein a very <hi>Nonsuch,</hi> for the enriching that <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which it passeth through: and yet no River in the World can outvie the same, or match therewith, for generating so great a number, and such a terrible kind of <hi>Crocodiles,</hi> out of the putrefactions of it. Nay, nearer home, we have enough of Evidence. Our richest Soyls, where Cultivation is neglected, are still obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to produce the rankest and most noysome Weeds. Yea, and within doors too, we ever find that delicate varieties of Meats, and Drinks, more often far Occasions Surfeits, and those more mortal, than plain and simple Food.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is this Rule less sure in <hi>Morals.</hi> Wheresoever <hi>Vice</hi> appeareth as a <hi>By-blow</hi> unto Vertue, (for it can never prove legitimate thereunto, till Darkness may, and truly too, call Light its Parent) it hath a fouler stain upon it, and is really more abominable, than it would have been, had it never claimed such a Pedigree. Hence is <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and the <hi>Subjects</hi> thereof, loathsome in the Eyes of God, and all good Men, to such a pitch as nothing more, or near so much. And rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son good; For in this case there is the basest <hi>Cheat,</hi> that can be, put upon us by the most ugly <hi>Monster,</hi> drest up in a <hi>Beauty</hi>'s Visor: and <hi>Purity</hi> is forced to act so vile a <hi>Miscreant,</hi> as not only to be a <hi>Prostitute,</hi> but very <hi>Pimp</hi> unto <hi>Pollution.</hi> And what is more abominable? But let us see the truth hereof made good in Instances. The <hi>Devil,</hi> that Prince of Darkness, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his pretences to an Angel of Light, was not in his Primitive Estate more highly <hi>glorious,</hi> and more truly <hi>good,</hi> than his Apostacy hath now made him basely <hi>vile,</hi> and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>naught.</hi> And, that I may touch the <hi>White</hi> I aim at, his eldest Son, the <hi>Man-of-Sin,</hi> and <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> (nick-nam'd his <hi>Holiness</hi>) was not in his low estate so much for <hi>Christ,</hi> as, since his <hi>Luciferian exaltation of himself,</hi> he hath been against <hi>Him,</hi> and prov'd <hi>the Antichrist:</hi> nor was his <hi>See,</hi> the seven-hill'd City, and Mystical Babylon, once more <hi>famous,</hi> as an <hi>Holy Temple with God,</hi> than at this day she is justly <hi>infamous</hi> for her degeneracy into a Stews of Filthiness, and <hi>very Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And truly hereof this Holy Apostle, as well as other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61760:13"/> Pen-men of Sacred Writ, having by Divine Revelation so clear a foresight, it ought to be no wonder to us, to find his serious reflections thereupon provoke him to so just a severity in stigmatizing that <hi>stupendious Romish Monster,</hi> as we shall manifestly see he doth in the Text before us. For, to say plain truth, we have his frightful Picture in this very Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter most lively drawn, in proper Colours, and just Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: yet so, as that a faithful Christian shall not need to be seared at the sight thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For, first, the Apostle bespeaks his <hi>Thessalonians</hi> with an affectionate suit, <hi>vers.</hi> 1.2. And, having so prepared them, then, with no surprize, and little disturbance, he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely draws the Curtain, and lets them see, That <hi>Hell above ground,</hi> whereof we speak, to <hi>vers.</hi> 10. But, lastly, he gives in full security against all mischief thence; to those, that is, who love the Truth; to the <hi>end of the Chapter:</hi> for of those three parts the whole consisteth. But for a strict enquiry into these several things, the Reader must excuse me from any further concern therein, than what is necessary for clearing of the way, that leads directly to my Journey's end.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In order whereunto, we may observe, that where St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as a careful Husbandman, had diligently sown his Corn, the Enemy also had been busie to cast in Tares: and so the Doctrine of the Gospel fell under jeopardy to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with the Leaven of <hi>false Teachers.</hi> For, in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's absence, an erronious Opini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Tradition from this Apostle,</hi> or at least <hi>some counterfeit Epistle from him;</hi> (which seems to be pointed at by those words in <hi>v.</hi> 2. By <hi>Spirit, or Word, or Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as from us;</hi> and wherein Papists, their true Disciples,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61760:14"/> most exactly tread their steps): This <hi>Errour,</hi> how innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soever by these, or other such-like Methods it might look, can find no favour at the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s hands, and he would have it speed no better with <hi>them</hi> by <hi>any</hi> means, if an Apostle's earnest Supplication may find succesful influence on them; as is most evident <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2. and beginning of the 3d.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And verily 'twas most reasonable, nay flatly necessary, to lay so great a Bar in the way thereof. Because, besides the falshood of it in it self, and the distracting trouble the belief thereof must needs create in the Minds of Men, the Apostle easily foresaw, that a <hi>Mine</hi> was made, and <hi>Train</hi> was laid hereby for blowing up the Gospel it self, our <hi>Magazin and Storehouse of all present Comforts, and future Hopes.</hi> For, admitting once that the Day of Judgment ought to have been expected in that Age, which was to be suspended till many hundreds more, (if not some thousands) at least, should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <head type="sub">Of the Bar, unto the Revelation of the Man of Sin.</head>
               <p>BUt here it will be worth our while,<note place="margin">The Bar to Antichrists Revelation.</note> by a brief Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Bar</hi> unto the Revelation of Antichrist, to make a fairer way for a fuller view of the Apostacy it self; and then the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> that heads it, which must succeed. This <hi>Bar,</hi> we must observe in our proceeding, lieth not simply against the <hi>Apostacy it self:</hi> but against the <hi>full growth,</hi> and <hi>plain Revelation thereof.</hi> This Apostle saith (as we heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>The Mystery of Iniquity doth already work: only he, who now letteth, will lett, until he be taken out of the way.</hi> And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pronounceth of the same time, <hi>Even Now there are many Antichrists,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.18. So that even then the Child was born, but not grown up: a Cloud was risen of the bigness of a Mans hand, but the Heaven was not altogether black with darkness yet: 'twas still fair day, not Sun-set hitherto, and much less Midnight; which was to be, when once what hindered was removed. But what was that, which <hi>letted</hi> then?</p>
               <p n="2">2. For answer, I have met with three Opinions only. The first is, that the <hi>Holy Spirit is this Bar:</hi> so some <hi>Nameless Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> anciently held, according to<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> also, long before, reporteth the same, and refutes it too; saying, If <hi>the Apostle had intended the Holy Spirit, verily, he would not have spoken it obscurely, but plainly,</hi> &amp;c. He adds
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61760:15"/>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Mox ibid.</note> there further, <hi>Had the Holy Ghost been the Bar, Antichrist must have been come already:</hi> that is, in case he must have come upon the ceasing of his extraordinary Gifts; <hi>For they are ceas'd a good while ago.</hi> But this conceit being not espoused, for any thing I know, by any considerable Person, then or since, need not detain us longer with it; and therefore let it rest in its own obscurity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A second carries greater probability with it, and is back'd with more Authority: namely, that <hi>the Gospel had not been preached yet throughout the World;</hi> and that was it, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred then, both the general Apostacy, and the Revelation of Antichrist. So<note n="(d)" place="margin">In locum.</note>
                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> heretofore,<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ap. Marl. Expos. Eccl.</note>
                  <hi>Calvin, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger, Sarcerius</hi> and <hi>Marlorat</hi> lately. Now 'tis most certain, that 'twas necessary the Gospel should be published, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained far and near, before there could be possibly an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal defection, and revolt from it. For 'tis equally absurd to speak of quitting any Principle, or Practice, that Men did never believe or walk in; as to say they left a Town, or Place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they never were in all their life time: or that a Souldier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from a General, whose pay he never took, nor ever was listed under him: and the proper Notion of<note n="*" place="margin">Budaeus Com. Graec. L.</note> Apostacy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth Souldiers, that forsake their Colours. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this, had the Apostle so intended, he had not need at all, and therefore likely would not have spoken so darkly in the Case, (as St. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> noted of the former Opinion.) Moreover it appeareth, as by<note n="(f)" place="margin">Euseb. H. Eccl. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Lastly, Therefore the <hi>greatest Names,</hi> and of the <hi>greatest Number,</hi> most surely with the <hi>greatest Reason</hi> on their side, do understand this Lett to be the <hi>Roman Empire:</hi> So that, He, <hi>who letteth, will lett, until he be taken out of the way,</hi> vers. 7. means but this, whilst the Roman Emperor shall hold his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61760:15"/> Power, and keep his Seat in the City of <hi>Rome, Antichrist</hi> must play least in sight: but, when this Empire shall decline, and place of Residence be removed, then expect to see the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> above Board, and in open view; that <hi>Head of the great Apostacy</hi> shall then shew his Head, and soon stretch his Hands unto the utmost bounds of Christian Profession. And verily, that this should be the very intent of the Apostle here, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, is very evident, as partly from the <hi>Text it self,</hi> so chiefly from the <hi>Event of things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. 'Tis plain enough from the <hi>Text,</hi> which hath two Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances very significant to this purpose. First, The Cryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique and obscure manner of describing this Impediment. He referreth them only to what he had before, by word of mouth, delivered on this Subject, and will by no means have it down in <hi>black and white,</hi> to be upon Record against him. He knew, his <hi>Lord</hi> would have the Wisdom of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent yok'd with the Innocency of the Dove; <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.16. and therefore quits himself as an apt <hi>Disciple.</hi> And what should this wary Carriage of the Business import else, but warm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, that he had of a dangerous provocation, which he should have given the <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> especially such a Monstrous Tyrant, as <hi>Nero</hi> was, who then swayed the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in case he had in plainest Terms expressed his mind. Should the Apostle have written in this broad Language, <hi>The Revelation of Antichrist is obstructed by the abode of the Imperial Power at Rome; when that is sunk, and gone from thence, which time is coming on, then shall the Man of Sin be seen as by a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Sun;</hi> what else in all Reason could have followed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon but joynt endeavours of the whole Empire (too much that way inclined already) to have sent packing such a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> and all <hi>Partakers</hi> with him, Root and Branch, from off the Earth? But to have said with open mouth, that either of the other Opinions put this <hi>Bar,</hi> had made no noise at all, and could not endanger Christians, by enraging of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. The presumption therefore is most strong, and just against both those, and for the last.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And then the hindrance being rendred as a Person, once and again in <hi>vers.</hi> 6. is the other Circumstance, that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61760:16"/> further to the same purpose, which being not applicable to the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> for the Reasons before specified out of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and by the very harshness of the sound, appearing altogether unapplicable to the <hi>Non-preaching of the Gospel through the World, must leave the Roman Emperor</hi> as pointed at by the Finger plainly. Nor doth there any difficulty arise upon the use of the <hi>Singular Number</hi> here; as if <hi>He that letteth,</hi> must necessarily be but <hi>One,</hi> when the <hi>Emperours of Rome</hi> were many after one another: for 'tis very familiar in <hi>common Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> and likewise in the <hi>Scripture-Phrase,</hi> for a <hi>Single Person to denote a whole Succession:</hi> as will<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="7">7. But the Event of things (which was the other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before proposed) so fully answering this Interpretation, and neither of the other, makes it, and it alone, pass current. For, whilst the <hi>Roman Emperour</hi> kept his ground at <hi>Rome,</hi> there was no room for <hi>Antichrist</hi> in the Chair. But not very long after the <hi>changing of his Seat,</hi> and quickly upon the <hi>sinking of his Power,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> usurps an Universal Monarchy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds <hi>the Antichrist.</hi> The <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> before a <hi>Minor,</hi> is now <hi>Adult</hi> and <hi>come to age:</hi> was formerly <hi>disguised,</hi> is now <hi>revealed.</hi> To make this plain by History were too remote from my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and indeed is needless; so many Reverend and Learned<note n="†" place="margin">Vide <hi>Dr.</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tak. <hi>de</hi> R.

                  <hi>Chrysostom</hi> upon the place. Now the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire having been removed so many hundred years ago, yea and reduced to a very <hi>Skeleton,</hi> or rather <hi>Ghost and Shadow of Empire</hi> (the <hi>Turk</hi> being Master of the East; <hi>many States and Kingdoms</hi> sharing with the <hi>Pope</hi> in the Soveraignty of the West: only, as so many Fathers Blessings, they hold forsooth their several Parts from Him; He would have them know, they are in duty bound to think so, and the <hi>German Emperour</hi> being rob'd

Now whether we follow them in this Trope, or rather understand it properly for a departure from the Faith; and so that <hi>Man of Sin</hi> not exegetically, but distinctly; for the Visible Head, and manager of this great Apostacy, (which seems more suitable to the Apostles mind) it comes at last to the same issue.

And truly otherwise 'twould seem to have been jumbled in, somewhat odly, among the Characters, whereby <hi>Antichrist</hi> should be known. Whereas to call him <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> as one who should arrive to such a desperate pitch of Villany, that vengeance necessarily must fall down
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61760:20"/> upon him at the last; First, Makes him knowable by a Brand upon his Forehead; Secondly, Continues the same Metoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the same sense, (and 'tis not likely the Apostle should use the same Trope in the same breath, in senses so remote, as the End and Adjunct); And lastly, Makes <hi>Antichrist</hi> a fit Successor unto <hi>Judas,</hi> from whom he had his name; and who, as his Predecessor, had earn'd that Title by <hi>peerless vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany,</hi> that brought his ruine. <hi>John</hi> 17.12.</p>

                  <hi>There are two things,</hi> saith the modest Gentleman, <hi>whereby this World is principally governed, The Holy Authority of Popes, and Regal Power. Of which so much the more weighty is the Priestly Charge, by how much 'tis obliged to give account at the Divine Audit for the Kings of Men themselves.</hi> And presently after; <hi>You know therefore this as well as other Matters, That you are to stand at their Bar, they are not to be brought to your beck. Many Popes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, back'd with such Ordinances, and with such Authorities,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61760:27"/> have excommunicated, some of them</hi> Kings, <hi>others of them</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. And particular Instances there are given of it in St. <hi>Innocent</hi> and St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> towards <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> Emperors. With this conclusion, though more at large, <hi>That Priestly Dignity excels the Regal, as Gold doth Lead: Necks of</hi> Kings and Princes <hi>stooping to the knees of</hi> Priests. I take it, here you have one that offers pretty fair, and may be taken for a tollerable Chapman; but the <hi>Decretals</hi> will afford ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that outbids him utterly. 'Tis <hi>Innocent</hi> (sadly nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd, Good Man) the 3d, unto the Emperor of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> A worthy Tale he telleth him, whereof the Cream is this;<note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>That as God created two great Lights, the greater to rule the Day, and lesser the Night: so in the Firmament of the Church there are two Dignities,</hi> the Papal Authority, and Regal Power. <hi>But that which ruleth the days, that is</hi> Spirituals, <hi>is greater; that which ruleth</hi> Carnals, <hi>the lesser: that as great as the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is between the</hi> Sun and Moon, <hi>so great the difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt</hi> Popes and Kings. I take it, here is a Wedg would reeve the hardest Block; and Argument enough to knock down <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Tartar,</hi> or the <hi>Great Mogul.</hi> Especially would they but consult the <hi>Gloss,</hi> (and 'tis fit the <hi>Comment</hi> should be clearer than the <hi>Text</hi>) they would see the Case as plain as the Nose in one's Face, forsooth; for there the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the <hi>Emperor</hi> is measured to an inch. And who would care to have it brought to an hairs breadth?

The truth is, the very plenty of proof doth make me poor at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of it. It being difficult for me, when I once begin, to make an end.

                  <hi>Cardinal Jesuite</hi> is in earnest, after a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, that <hi>Peter</hi> was the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Monarch of the Christian Church, to prove the Pope's succession in this very <hi>grave,</hi> yet <hi>witty</hi> manner too. <hi>Some Body ought by Divine right</hi> (saith he) <hi>to succeed</hi> Peter: <hi>That can be no Body else but the Pope of</hi> Rome: <hi>Therefore he succeeds him.</hi> Now that some Body must succeed, is gathered (as he tells you) <hi>from the end of the Popeship:</hi> for <hi>sure it is,</hi> (they are his words translated) <hi>The Pope is for the Church, not the Church for the Pope. And so must not die with</hi> Peter; <hi>but last as long as it.</hi> I Answer; 'Twere not impertinent to say, <hi>The Pope is for the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.13.</note>
                  <hi>just as the Wolf is for the Sheep:</hi> but let that pass. Were not Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists for the Church too? Was not Christ's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence upon Earth also? And were not many, many other things besides? What then; must they all last as long as the Church? Ridiculous! But he urgeth further; <hi>The Church hath more need now of one General Pastor, than in the Apostles times; Christians now being more, and worse. And therefore since it had one then, it must have now.</hi> And why, I pray, hath not the <hi>Church more need also of those other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers spoken of,</hi> for his Reasons? But admitting <hi>one General Pastor then,</hi> how cogent his way of arguing is, see by a like case. <hi>The World at first had but One Master of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: Now Men are more, and worse:</hi> Ergo, <hi>It should have but one still.</hi> Though in very truth, <hi>The Church neither then had, nor now needeth any other Ʋniversal Pastor, than the Great Shepherd of our Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is at it 2ly, <hi>The Church is always one and the same; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having had such a Pastor once, it must have still.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: the Roman Common-Wealth was one and the same,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61760:47"/> under Consuls, Decemvirs, Tribunes, and Dictators, though the form of Government was not. And if we now must have the Church governed as 'twas then, there must be many Chief Rulers, as the Twelve Apostles were, and therefore one cannot serve the turn: and so farewel Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to their Monarchy.</p>
               <p>And 3dly and 4ly he urgeth, <hi>Feed my Sheep. Feeding,</hi> saith he, <hi>is an ordinary and perpetual Office. And Sheep are All, as well as One. And all, respecting Times, as well as Places. But</hi> Peter <hi>could not live always to do this: Succession therefore is necessary.</hi> So he. And <hi>Christ</hi> bids the Apostles, <hi>Teach all Nations.</hi> Let us try his Logick here a little. <hi>Teaching is ordinary, and perpetual: Nations are all, as well as one: all, respecting all Times, as well as places too: And the Apostles were not to live always:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Succession unto every one of them is necessary.</hi> Were not this fine work, and much to the Pope's advantage.</p>
               <p>He tells us 5ly, <hi>The Church is one Body,</hi> and <hi>must have one Head,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. and <hi>Peter being dead, it is not fit it should be Headless.</hi> But I tell him, the Apostle in that place he quoteth, never dreameth of a <hi>General Mortal Monarch.</hi> Only by a Similitude shews, how useful Christians of meaner Gifts, as well as greater, may be one unto another: and therefore all should be united closely for the Common Service, by the strictest ties of dearest Charity. As for the Head, that influenceth, rules, and governs the whole Church, <hi>Christ</hi> only is so called, and not <hi>Peter,</hi> Eph. 1.22, 23. Col. 1.18.</p>
               <p>Lastly, he saith, <hi>There was Succession in the Priesthood of the Old Testament; but that was a Figure of the New Testament Priesthood. Therefore</hi> Peter<hi>'s Succession must be kept.</hi> And why not, by his leave; <hi>a Succession therefore to the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles also?</hi> But that <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Priesthood should be a Type of any other than <hi>His,</hi> who is a <hi>Priest for ever after the Order of Melchisedech,</hi> was never heard of, nor will be, from the Scriptures.

For <hi>Feeding</hi> is a great way off from <hi>Ruling;</hi> yet both are common to every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour. What's there for Catholick Headship then? But the mischief is, The Pope, howe're, is nothing a-kin to <hi>Peter;</hi> as was prov'd before. Wall, let's try again.<note n="*" place="margin">Ibidem.</note>
                  <hi>The Civil and Ecclesiastical Swords both are in his hands.</hi> And good reason too no doubt!

                  <hi>The Pope is above

Nor were there any <hi>such Vows</hi> ever among the Jews. 3. Nor could a y Vow be made by <hi>Children,</hi> under Government, without their Parents. 4. And how <hi>sensless</hi> were it to imagine, that Parents would by allowing such a Vow, frankly foregoe so great a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing as just hopes of seeing Childrens Children? 5. Or can a Person in his wits think the espousing <hi>Mary unto Joseph</hi> was for any other, than that serious End, to enjoy the Blessing spoken of? 6. And can it savour of any thing else but <hi>Lunacy,</hi> to pretend, as Papists do, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Espousal was, to <hi>preserve</hi> (forsooth) <hi>the Vow of her Virginity?</hi> Away with such a Bedlam Dotage. In the second Scripture, we have no more of a <hi>Vow</hi> neither. Not one <hi>Jota,</hi> that is. And known it is that many live and die <hi>Virgins,</hi> without a <hi>Vow</hi> upon them. Nay, the Continency of that Text is that <hi>which all cannot receive,</hi> our Saviour saith, <hi>v.</hi> 11. But Popish Continency by Vow,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61760:57"/> they tell us, <hi>All are capable of if they will.</hi> To be sure then, <hi>their Vow is not intended by that Text.</hi> For the last. <hi>Faith</hi> was never used in the Scriptures for a <hi>Vow;</hi> much less, a <hi>Vow of Continency.</hi> A <hi>[first Faith]</hi> therefore for <hi>such a Vow,</hi> least of all.

First for the <hi>Manner of their Teaching.</hi> Oh what rare streins of Doctrine flow from the Roman Lips; and in what an Elegant Style! (For both those things I must have couch'd together, I mean, their Matter and Words.) That this must needs be very wonderful, I durst appeal, without producing further Testimony, to those that have but read, and not forgotten the former Pair, of <hi>Principles and Proofs</hi> with Papists. Howe're, to clear the Truth yet more, and further please my Reader, I will take the pains to give him fresh and full content, I'le warrant him, about the Premises. And if those Sermons may with scorn be wondred at, that give the People <hi>Serpents</hi> instead of <hi>Fish;</hi> or at the best but <hi>Stones</hi> for <hi>Bread:</hi> ne're let him doubt, but that there are enough of such with those of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To begin then with an <hi>Exhortation,</hi> (for I hope you will not stand upon the Punctilio of a Text,<note place="margin">Epistol. Jesuit. Libel. Ep. 3. N. 9. Inter <hi>Chamier.</hi> Ep. Jesuit. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vae 1599.</note> and so, at all times). A <hi>Jesuit Priest,</hi> Master of one of their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in the Year 1584, thus among other things instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his Disciples on Good-Friday. <hi>In this Holy Time of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61760:70"/> Lent you have willingly heard the History of the Passion of our Lord, out of the four Evangelists; you have performed many Penances, with Watchings, Fastings, Prayers, Pilgrimages, Sack-cloaths, Whippings, and the like, whereby you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed your selves to Christ, and fulfilled his Passion, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for your sins. But I tell you, all these things will do you not one farthings worth of good, if you do not to morrow, according to the command of our Superiors, All and Singular of you confess your sins, and receive the Sacrament in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick manner. Because the</hi> Holy Roman Church, <hi>which we ought to hear in all things, commandeth this. To hear many Sermons willingly, willingly and frequently to read the Holy Scripture, is in truth</hi> No sign of a good Catholick, but rather of an Heretick, <hi>who delight themselves therewith,</hi> as an Ape doth with a Nut. <hi>But the</hi> Only delight of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>is to hear many Masses, and often to confess him. He that neglecteth or despiseth this, offends more heinously, Than He that never heard a Sermon all his Life, or never saw a Bible.</hi> So he. But when a poor <hi>Disciple</hi> of intimate Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the <hi>Exhorter,</hi> ask'd him, How he prov'd his Doctrine? The Answer was; <hi>Holy Mother Church of Rome hath so ordained: whom if you do not simply obey, you will not be a good Catholick. The Roman Church saith not,</hi> The Word The Word, The Scripture The Scripture: <hi>but</hi> Mass and Confession. She is the Mistris, and the Living Law, and Word of God. <hi>Scripture is a Dead Letter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining nothing against the Authority of the Church of Rome; as a Daughter will not against her Mother, nor a Servant, or Scholar, against his Lord and Master.</hi>

               <p>Here is Popish Doctrine with a Vengeance: and all as <hi>well held forth!</hi> Wherby the <hi>Holy Jesus</hi> must have a Fescue <hi>held him</hi> by the <hi>Wicked Pope.</hi>

Our first Parents were in great distress in</hi> Rome, <hi>once upon a time, and knew not how to get their living. A certain Brother goes to the Market, with intent to beg from door to door. But on his way he prays the</hi> Virgin Mary <hi>to incline their hearts, whose Charity he should ask. He had scarce said the words; but behold a Noble Person, richly attired, gives him in his hands an hundred Crowns without asking. Home comes the Brother, and acquaints</hi> Ignatius. <hi>Our Fathers thought it was the Devil:</hi> (shrewdly guess'd; for why should not he be sometimes kind to his own Children?) <hi>They call upon the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and received this Answer,</hi> (from the said Devil you may be sure on't) <hi>That she heard the Brothers Prayer.</hi> In the same Sermon they are told, <hi>That Jesuits could cast out Devils without controul.

But when our Order came, from that one Maiden they expelled</hi> 12652 <hi>Devils, that is, Two Legions.

Even so</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is as unseemly a thing to see a Man wear a Sword by his side, who knows not how to use it.</hi> And so, besides the Cause assigned touching our Saviour's Command to <hi>Peter,</hi> of forbearing to use his Sword, he concludes two great Points out of that Text. <hi>First, That St.</hi> Peter <hi>meant to have cut off</hi> Malchus <hi>Head, when he cut his Ear off; but that he somewhat missed his blow. And secondly, That the Blade wherewith he cut his Ear off, was</hi> (forsooth) <hi>a Rapier. Keen</hi> Discourses; and <hi>Poynant</hi> Proofs! able to enlighten even <hi>Cimmerian Darkness!</hi>

Whereupon I said to my Man, Spur, Spur. Sir,</hi> quoth he, <hi>I spur him: but certainly he seeth something. Then I remembred that it had been told my deceased Brother, that certain Apparitions had been seen there. I said my</hi> Pater Noster <hi>and</hi> Ave Mary, <hi>which my good Mother taught me. And having so done, I bad my Man spur again; which he did.

                  </note>The Text is <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> The Sermon thus begins. S. <hi>Agnes in these words doth glory of the mutual love, that was betwixt her Husband,</hi> Christ, and her self. <hi>We must know that there are many things for which God is wont to love Men.</hi> First, Is <hi>Charity,</hi> Prov. 8. <hi>I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. We find this in S.</hi> Agnes, <hi>that early,</hi> i. <hi>in her youth she sought God:</hi> and <hi>therefore she found him.</hi> And out comes her <hi>Legend.</hi> For, <hi>coming from School, the City Governor's Son meets, and falls in love with, and gives great Gifts to her, but she scorns all:</hi> and so on. <hi>Second thing for which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61760:73"/> God loveth is Faith.</hi> S. Agnes <hi>had firm Faith. For when 'twas told her,</hi> Either <hi>Sacrifice to the Gods with other Virgins, or Whore with the Whores in a Whorehouse: and she was put naked into the Stews: God made her Hair so</hi> thick, that it covered her better than her Garments, <hi>&amp;c. Third is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, or Virginal Cleanness. This</hi> S. Agnes <hi>had:</hi> and <hi>therefore her Husband</hi> Christ <hi>loved her:</hi> and <hi>preserved her pure in the Stews. For the Governors Son going into her, dyed. But at her Prayer was raised again from the dead. When she was cast into the Fire, it divided, burnt the People standing about her; but her self was not touched. At last her Throat was cut. Yet a Priest, much tempted by the Flesh, was cured by going to her Image,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Thou art all fair my Love; and there is no Spot in thee. In the words proposed; The Lord commends</hi> Margaret <hi>his Spouse from her Beauty. She was beautiful in</hi> Body and Soul. <hi>The Beauty of her</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is <hi>touch'd there, Thou art all fair my Love: but the beauty of her</hi> Soul is <hi>touch'd there;</hi> and <hi>There is no Spot in thee. For the beauty of her</hi> Body, Olibrius <hi>loved her: for the beauty of her</hi> Soul, <hi>God.</hi> Then he proves both that of her <hi>beauty,</hi> and Olibrius <hi>his love</hi> by a <hi>Tale of a Tub,</hi> that is, <hi>her Legend.</hi> Now for the <hi>inward Beauty;</hi> that of the Soul, that is, it <hi>consisteth chiefly in two things;</hi> viz. <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Chastity.</hi> And he proves it by S. <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> Wisdom the 4th, O quam pulchra est casta generatio cum Charitate! q. d. (he goes on) <hi>O how fair is the Soul that is kindled with Charity; and herewith is Chast!</hi> S. Magaret <hi>had them both. Her Charity is seen by her enduring death for God. In Goal the Devil came to her like a Dragon, to devour her: She made the Sign of the Cross, the Dragon crack'd asunder in the middle. Then he came to her like a Man; but she catch'd him by the Head, and trampled him under her feet. Then the Devil howled and said, let me be gone and I will come near thee no more.</hi> At last; <hi>they cut off her Head, and she praying to Christ, said, I thank thee, O Lord, that thou hast brought my Combate unto Victory.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61760:74"/> Have mercy, I pray thee, of them who shall commemorate me;</hi> and <hi>shall call upon me in their Necessities; and mercifully help</hi> Women in Travail <hi>that pray to me. And a Voice came from Heaven which said, her request was heard.</hi> This is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this Sermon also. And whether they be not a brace of <hi>choice Preachments,</hi> let the Reader judg; whilst I bring on the other.</p>

                  <hi>even unto the end of the World. This Sermon is the last of all about the Saints.</hi> But whether the Saint were Man or Woman; both, or neither; I'le not meddle. 'Tis the Great <hi>Saint Mass.</hi> Where the Preacher, after a very short Preface, falling to his business, tells us, <hi>Then G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d will be with us, when we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and devoutly hear the Mass.</hi> Whence 'tis said, <hi>Lo I am with you,</hi> &amp;c. (That you may see, how naturally their Doctrines are deduced from the Scripture: or rather what ignorant and impudent Abusers of the Sacred Text they are in their most solemn use thereof!) Whence (he goes on) In <hi>this present Sermon we must speak of the twelve Benefits every one hath, that devoutly and diligently hears Mass.</hi> (Whereto both Text and Bible wholly is an utter stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; indeed to the Tenor thereof a professed Enemy.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the</hi> first <hi>Benefit</hi> (saith the Preacher) <hi>is: That if a Man should give in Alms as much Ground as he could walk over whilst the Mass is saying, 'twould not do him so much good as the hearing</hi> Mass. (And the proof is this <hi>Praters</hi> bare word, and nothing else.)</p>
               <p>Second; <hi>That Angels will delightfully stay with that Man,</hi> and <hi>carefully keep him.</hi> (And as well proved as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.)</p>
               <p>Third; <hi>His Venial Sins are thereby forgiven.</hi> This is done nine ways at least. By taking Holy-Water, saying <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor,</hi> bowing to Jesus or <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c. But the last is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, which is this. <hi>As many Pater-Nosters as are said in that Mass, or</hi> out of it <hi>either;</hi> (mark that!) <hi>for every Pater-Noster Venial Sins are pardoned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourth; <hi>He that in mortal Sins hears the Mass, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Church, when Christ is sacrificed on the Altar, all his Mortal sins are pardoned.</hi> For <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Hassia upon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61760:75"/> Genesis, saith, Christ living on Earth denyed mercy to none that faithfully sought it: And said to the Thief upon the Cross;</hi> This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise: <hi>and to Mary Magdalen,</hi> Thy sins are forgiven thee.</p>
               <p>Fifth; <hi>He that is present at Mass, may every day spiritually communicate.</hi> Augustine <hi>saith, Believe and thou hast eaten.</hi> And so his saying heartily, I would, but dare not for my unworthiness partake of this Grace; doth spiritually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</p>
               <p>Sixth; <hi>He shall be a greater partaker that day, of all the good things done in the Church by all Christ's faithful through the whole World.</hi> Psal. 119.63. <hi>I am a Companion of all them that fear thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventh; <hi>Thy Prayer is sooner heard in the Church, and presence of God. For 'tis</hi> piously to be believed, <hi>that that Saint, or those Saints, of whom the Mass is read, yea Angels who are present, do pray for him that celebrates, and them that stand round. And such Prayers are sooner heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eight; <hi>The Souls for whom the Mass is said, or for whom the standers by do pray, have special comfort hereby. Witness that Soul that was to abide fifteen years in Purgatory, and was delivered by one Mass.</hi> ('Tis true, here's my hand!)</p>
               <p>Ninth; <hi>One Mass in ones life time devoutly heard, is more worth than a thousand after death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenth; <hi>A Woman with Child devoutly present at Mass, if she should fall in Travail the same day, 'tis to be hoped, that God will make her a joyful Childbearer, and the Angels will carefully keep Mother and Child. But let her devoutly pray at Mass-time to the</hi> Virgin Mary, <hi>to be a glad Mother, as she was at the birth of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eleventh; <hi>Whatsoever a Man eats that day, it agrees better to his Nature after the Mass, than before. Moreover he will be prosper'd that day in his Labour, Craft, Buyings, Journies. Nor will he be poorer at the years end, if he hear Mass every day.</hi> Mat. 6. <hi>Seek first God's Kingdom, and all these things shall be added.</hi> (But this is running from God's Kingdom!)</p>
               <p>Twelfth; <hi>If thou happen to die that day thou hearest Mass;</hi> Christ <hi>will be present with thee in thy extremity, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61760:75"/> stand by thee as thou didst by him in hearing Mass.</hi> (Which he comes not near; for his Soul abhors it.) Luke 6. <hi>With what measure ye meet, it shall be measured to you again.</hi> But enough of Conscience hence also. Now let the Reader judg what a precious couple of Sermons these are likewise! And if he can endure it, I shall devour the tediousness of one Pair of Preachers more: and then let them go for a Pack of Notorious, <hi>Bedlam, Prophane,</hi> and <hi>Ʋngodly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers,</hi> as they are!</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Preacher upon whom I am now attending, was that famous Popish Doctor and Bishop, <hi>Jacobus de Voragine;</hi> so called, because they reckon him a very Gulf of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and of Divinity you may be sure, particulary. And his Discourses have no meaner Title Than <hi>Golden Sermons.</hi> You justly therefore may expect no thin diluted Matter; but the very Cream from him. Well then; Text <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.17.<note place="margin">De S. Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co. Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m. 4. Serm. 201.</note>
                  <hi>And sent his Servant at Supper-time:</hi> And thus this Gallant Preacher doth begin. <hi>By the Supper, the End of the World, by the Servant, the Order of Predicators</hi> (that is, <hi>S. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks) is signified. S.</hi> Dominick <hi>was the Founder of this Order. But three things are required to the goodness of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> Mat. 24. <hi>Who is a faithful and wise Servant?</hi> That faithfulness S. <hi>Dominick kept for God. For three things he received of God, Body, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals: which he</hi> faithfully <hi>gave to God again. For of his</hi> Flesh, <hi>he gave to God</hi> Purity; <hi>of his</hi> Mind, <hi>devout</hi> Prayer; <hi>of</hi> Temporals, <hi>a liberal</hi> distribution <hi>to the Poor.</hi> And so on.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>To the goodness of a Servant belongeth</hi> Cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Psalm. <hi>He that walketh in an undefiled way shall serve me.</hi> S. <hi>Dominick had that</hi> Cleanliness; <hi>because he kept his Virginity pure. Which Virginity of his was much as the</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary<hi>'s, as far as was possible. She had</hi> Perfect Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <hi>in Mind and Body.</hi> So S. <hi>Dominick. One is not enough without the other. For the Angel appeared to John,</hi> Revel. 1. With a <hi>Golden Girdle about his Breast,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then the</hi> Blessed Virgin <hi>had a Virginity dedicated unto Christ: for she first
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61760:76"/> vowed and dedicated her self to God.</hi> So S. <hi>Dominick. Vowed and sold his Virginity to God.</hi> Prov. <hi>ult. She maketh fine Linnen,</hi> and <hi>selleth it,</hi> &amp;c. By <hi>fine Linnen, which is brought to whiteness by many clippings, is signified Virginity; which is gotten by many macerations.</hi> And lastly <hi>the</hi> Virgin Mary <hi>had a transfusive Virginity; which quenched all concupiscence in others towards her.</hi> (Silliness turn blasphemous now.) <hi>Thus 'twas with S. Dominick.</hi> For <hi>when a certain Scholar</hi> (A true and perfect Lying Wonder!) <hi>suffered a slip of the Flesh, and kiss'd his hand, the odour of that Maiden-hand pierc'd his heart, and quench'd the heat of his Lust. Therefore his odour may be compared to that of Cedar and Myrrh. For as the Odour of Cedar drives away Serpents,</hi> and <hi>of</hi> Myrrh <hi>Worms; so the Odour of his purity</hi> unclean thoughts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Vigilancy is required to the goodness of a Servant.</hi> Luk. 12. <hi>Blessed are those Servants whom their Lord shall find watching.</hi> S. <hi>Dominick mightily watched in Prayer. His Prayers had six great Circumstances.</hi> 1. Fervent. <hi>He watched frequently all night in the Cloathes he came out of the Bath with: and in the morning they were drier than those that hung all night by the fire.</hi> 2. Efficacious. <hi>For he</hi> told a <hi>Friend he never asked any thing of God, but had it as he desired.</hi> 3. Light; <hi>and therefore mounted to Heaven. That is</hi> heavy Prayer, <hi>which is clog'd with the load of sin. He was without sin.</hi> (Gross Lyar, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8.) 4. <hi>Continual.</hi> 5. <hi>Devout.</hi> 6. <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. O <hi>the choice Hints of this amazing Sermon!</hi> Yet I pass by five on the <hi>same Subject,</hi> viz. S. <hi>Dominick.</hi> How will <hi>foul</hi> Blasphemy; <hi>gross</hi> Falshood; <hi>idle, childish,</hi> and <hi>delirant</hi> Impertinency edifie a bewitched Auditory! Let's try again.</p>

This Glorious Pulpiteer sets out. <hi>Holy Men, how holy soever they are in Heart, desire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless to be holy in their Body.</hi> 2 Cor. 7. <hi>Let us cleanse our selves from filthiness of Flesh and Spirit.</hi> Psalm. <hi>My Heart and my Flesh rejoyced in the living God. These two things S.</hi> Francis <hi>had;</hi> viz. a <hi>holy Body and Soul. That it might be truly said of him,</hi> He that is Holy, viz. <hi>in Soul;</hi> let him
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61760:76"/>
                  <hi>be more holy, viz. in Body.</hi> (Rare Interpretation!)</p>
               <p>First, <hi>He had an Holy Body:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>for all things that were in him were holy. Let's begin at the</hi> Head, <hi>and go down to the</hi> Feet. <hi>We shall see that from the</hi> Sole of his Foot, to the Crown of his Head, <hi>there was nothing but Holiness in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His</hi> Hair <hi>was holy.</hi> (And but for modesty, 'tis like, he would have said the same expresly of his worser Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments likewise.) <hi>For when a Man's House was falling, he took a little of his Hair, and put it into the Clefts, and the House stood firm, being established by the brittle</hi> Hair <hi>of the Holy Man.</hi> (Bravely said!)</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His</hi> Eyes <hi>were holy. For thence came such quantities of devout Tears, that his sight was weakned. And when he was warned to forbear weeping, he answered, that there is no reason that for the love of this light, which the Flies have as well as we, the visitation of the inward Light should be driven away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>His</hi> Ears <hi>were holy. For they deserved to hear the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Voice, and Angelical joyful shouting. He deserved to hear the Divine Voice thrice. And the Angels sung sweetly to him, when he was sick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>His</hi> Mouth <hi>was holy: for such powerful words came thence, that whom he blessed they were blessed; and they were cursed whom he cursed.</hi> Witness (two Strappers!) <hi>the</hi> Sow <hi>that died for eating a very tame Lamb, when he had curs'd her;</hi> and <hi>the</hi> Girl, <hi>whose sight was restored by his Spittle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>His</hi> Hands <hi>holy: for they were so consecrated with the Wounds, that the things he touched were holy. As</hi> Bread, <hi>which cured the Sick.</hi> (And more lies to the Bargain.)</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>So his</hi> Nails: <hi>for a tempted Brother, by pairing his Nails, and keeping it as Relicks,</hi> (the Parings that is) <hi>was freed and much comforted.</hi> (O that he had but turn'd a Gold-s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8. <hi>And his</hi> Cord Girdle: <hi>Which dipt in Water,</hi> cur'd all Distempers. (More new parts of an humane Body!)</p>
               <p n="9">9, <hi>His</hi> Body <hi>was holy. For whipping himself against bad
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61760:77"/> motions, he said, Go to,</hi> Brother Ass, <hi>thus you must be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, thus you must be lashed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Likewise his</hi> Feet; <hi>being consecrated with Christ's Wounds. Whence, by the sprinkling the Water wherein they were washed, Cattel were cured of the Murrein.</hi> A just Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing! And lower this Holy Prater goeth not about this Holy Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Soul.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>But</hi> secondly <hi>His</hi> Soul <hi>was holy</hi> (with a vengeance!) <hi>For when it went out of his Body, 'twas seen like a Star as big as the Moon; but the light thereof as great as the Sun. Great as the</hi> Moon, <hi>for his great Charity; light as the Sun, for his knowledg of God.</hi> And so on, to the end of the <hi>Rhapsody of witless Lies.</hi>

And 'tis no wonder; For this Wine was so strong, that when he was to drink of it, he sweated blood, by reason of its strength,</hi> i. <hi>the fear of his Passion. And he was so drunk with this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61760:77"/> Wine, that like a drunken Man he gave away all he had; his</hi> Mother <hi>to his Disciple, his</hi> Disciple <hi>to his Mother; his</hi> Kingdom <hi>to a Robber, his</hi> Body <hi>to the Jews, his</hi> Garments <hi>to the Souldiers, his</hi> Soul <hi>to his Father.

The Scholar, that was his Lanthorn-bearer, and led the way, made shift to put them pretty well by: but the good Man himself, being old and weak, grew pale, and trembled, lest that, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Sacrament, he should be tumbled down into the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61760:80"/> Dirt. Yet taking hearty Grace,</hi> he <hi>spendeth this short Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Asses.</hi> O Asses: what is the thing that ye are doing!

               <p>It is less wonder, I confess, to find the <hi>Sheep,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But these are all Tame Creatures. Yet they were<note n="*" place="margin">Capg. Nov.

To <hi>attempt</hi> converting him, a Man would think would ask more <hi>Fortitude</hi> than Humane Store affordeth: no doubt requires an Angelical stock of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to <hi>effect</hi> it.

The <hi>Wolf</hi> runs open mouth'd upon him: but with the foresaid <hi>Weapon,</hi> the <hi>Sign of the Cross,</hi> the S. puts by <hi>that Pass,</hi> both from himself and fellow. Strait then a <hi>Parly sounds;</hi> and <hi>S. Francis</hi> thus begins. <hi>Come to me, Brother Wolf: and in the Name of Christ I charge thee hurt me not, nor any Body else.</hi> O wonderful! down falls the Wolf just like a Lamb, upon the sudden, at the Saints feet. To him thus penitent the Saint goes on. <hi>Brother Wolf, thou dost a world of mischief in these parts, destroying God's Creatures, without all mercy; not only Brutes, but Men, that are made in God's likeness; whence thou deservest grievous death:</hi> and more on to that purpose. But, <hi>Brother Wolf,</hi> saith he, (insinuating most sweetly into his affections) <hi>I will make peace 'twixt thee and them; that they forgive what is past,</hi> and <hi>thou forbear the like in time to come:</hi> with a great deal more to the same purpose. The <hi>Wolf,</hi> by shaking of his <hi>Body, Tayl,</hi> and <hi>Ears;</hi> and by the bowing of his <hi>Head,</hi> shewed his acceptance of the Tearms. And at the last <hi>shakes hands</hi> upon the Bargain; that is, <hi>stretch'd out his right forefoot,</hi> and <hi>kindly put it into S. Francis hand. Which was repeated also before the People within the City after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> Whereupon the S. in a Sermon upon that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tells the People, <hi>That Brother Wolf</hi> (a Man would scarce have thought, but that the Ass we heard of had been some-what nearer of Kin than he) <hi>had now made peace with them for ever,</hi> upon those <hi>Equal Terms,</hi> whereof he likewise gives them notice.

               <p>NOw <hi>Popish Sacraments</hi> must be considered. Although it cannot but be confess'd, these are not much more Miraculous for their <hi>Nature,</hi> than the <hi>Number</hi> of them. We will then for special Reason look upon their <hi>Number</hi> first.</p>

               <p>But why should we travel far abroad, when we have such plenty of these kind of Instances at home?

               <p>But <hi>London</hi> is the less to be pittied, because it would not take fair warning.

               <p>Verily 'tis <hi>great</hi> Wages for a very <hi>little</hi> work: Let them look to it whose <hi>Shooes are made of running Leather,</hi> as far as unto <hi>Rome</hi> it self; lest they <hi>go further and fare worse,</hi> as we use to say.</p>
               <p>Well, but a little onward in that Book,<note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 66.</note> and for a deal less work, you have a Reward that is far more ample: <hi>Ten thousand years of pardon for one very short prayer, with a Pater Noster,</hi> and <hi>Ave-Mary after it.</hi> Onely, <hi>you must be sure to nick the Season; 'Tis at the Masse, just between the Elevation of our Lord,</hi> and <hi>the three Agnus Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But such as are for <hi>more pains-taking,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 62.</note> (and 'twill fetch no Blood, nor make them sweat, I'l warrant them,) let them but <hi>before the Image of pity devoutly say Five</hi> Pater-Noster<hi>'s, and Five</hi> Ave<hi>'s, and a</hi> Credo; <hi>piteously behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Not a Farmer in our Parish but will say, 'tis <hi>full as good as any Fee-simple in the World.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>hath granted as many dayes of Pardon as there were Wounds in the Body of our Lord at the time of his bitter Passion; the which were five thousand four hundred threescore and five.</hi> (Not one more nor less you may be sure. A great Secret to the poor He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.) But here's not half the Bargain yet: For Pope <hi>Sixtus hath granted to all them that in a State of Grace</hi> (at any time to be had with a wet finger, as you heard,) <hi>say it immediately after the Elevation of the Body of our Lord,</hi> CLEAN REMISSION OF ALL THEIR SINS PERPETUALLY ENDURING.</p>
               <p>Here's now a <hi>Purchase</hi> worth the having; and yet which in a manner costeth nothing: <hi>SIXTƲS,</hi> I say, <hi>for my Money!

That so all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians dead already might mount strait to Heaven; and those that shall dye, as soon as ever they leave the Earth; at most, onely be bound to call at the Black Prison door, to vex that spitefull Jaylor, in the perceiving how his revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Malice against poor Mankind meets with a Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Charity of his Holiness.</hi> Sure either the Pope must fear, that if he take this course, <hi>Heaven will be so full, that himself and Creatures will get no room there:</hi> Or, which is far more l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Well; <hi>they come to chassering;</hi> and at last <hi>to strike the bargain.</hi> The <hi>Gentleman gives him ready down upon the Nayl,</hi> and <hi>takes his Bull with him.</hi> Not long after, watching his Opportunity, he meets that <hi>very Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in a Wood, as he was travelling with his Wares and Cash about him;</hi> and very fairly <hi>then</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> he <hi>robs my Chapman of every penny.</hi> Tecelius <hi>brandisheth a whole Shop-full of Curses at him.</hi> But the <hi>Gentleman shews his High-pric'd Bull:</hi> And with great mirth tells him; <hi>This was

               <p>And now whatever cause of wonder <hi>Romish Pardons</hi> may justly give the Reader, I cannot think this <hi>Gentleman's Practice</hi> thereupon affordeth any: <hi>Excepting alwayes the Ingenuity of the Feat.</hi> My reason is, because <hi>the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Sin with open face,</hi> and <hi>Extirpation of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue out of the World, are Twins conceived in,</hi> and <hi>brought forth from this Womb; which never can have other Issue.</hi> For who will dread that <hi>Evil,</hi> which a wet finger can put by; or be industrious for that <hi>Good,</hi> which may be had by sitting still?

The <hi>Youngster</hi> had a Board in his hand, the knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereon might be heard below.

At last, after innumerable <hi>Knaveries,</hi> a <hi>Doctors</hi> voice, that acts St. <hi>Mary</hi> one night, begins to be <hi>a little known</hi> unto him.

The drift was for the destruction of the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> who held that <hi>Errour</hi> touching the <hi>Blessed Virgin;</hi> and the <hi>City</hi> is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ruine by this <hi>Fellow</hi> in his <hi>Extasy</hi> as from the <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi> unless a speedy course be taken with them; and this in presence of the <hi>chief Magistrates.</hi> Now the <hi>turn</hi> was serv'd, and the <hi>cursed Monks</hi> gape for the <hi>poor Mans</hi> death; and accordingly give him <hi>a poyson'd Host.</hi> But he suspecting, refuseth it.

                  <hi>Baronius</hi> is a more Splendid and Authentick Author. He saith, <hi>John Damascene</hi> being in command with the King of <hi>Saracens,</hi> wrote many Invectives against <hi>Leo Isau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> Emperour, for his opposing <hi>Image-Worship.</hi> The <hi>Emperour</hi> being vexed, and not being able otherwise to be reveng'd upon <hi>John,</hi> because he was out of his reach, contriveth, (saith the <hi>Tale,</hi>) this Plot against him. Having gotten some of <hi>Johns</hi> own hand Writing, he frames a Letter from him to himself, in alike Stile and Characters unto <hi>Johns,</hi> for betraying the City and Country of that <hi>Saracens King</hi> where <hi>John</hi> commanded into his, the <hi>Emperours</hi> hands.

But at <hi>Evening</hi> when 'twas thought <hi>the King</hi> might be somewhat pacified, <hi>Damascen</hi> sends an humble Petition, that <hi>since his Pain was intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and would not be abated whilst his Hand hung up in the Air, it might please him to let him take it down, and bury it in the ground, for the asswaging his Pain.</hi> His request is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But instead of burying it he makes haste therewith to his <hi>Oratory</hi> at Home; and there falling down before the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> puts his Hand to the Wrist from whence 'twas cut off, and with Groaning and Tears imploreth her help: concluding his Prayer, <hi>That she could do what she would, because she was the Mother of God.</hi> He prays himself asleep (his <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> were cqually great the <hi>mean time!</hi>) and then sees the <hi>Virgins Image</hi> look pleasantly upon him, and saying; <hi>Behold, thy Hand is whole,</hi> He wakes over-joyed, you must think, and finds it <hi>most true.</hi> To this purpose the <hi>Cardinal:</hi> nor need we other <hi>Examples.</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, The Story only serves for <hi>Image-Worship;</hi> and therefore being calculated to the behoof of an <hi>utter and abominable Lye,</hi> 'tis <hi>reasonable; just</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> to be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>such it self.</hi>

And anon, (after <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Copy whereof but lately) he goeth on, <hi>The work of Faith that worketh by Love, is the compunction of the Heart, whereby doubtless Devils are cast out, when sins are rooted out of the Heart. Then Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Christ speak with new Tongues, when old words are gone from their Mouth, and they henceforth use not the old tongue of their first Parents that swerv'd to words of naughtiness, for justifying excuses in their Sins. But, when by compunction of Heart, and confession of Mouth, their Sins are destroyed; to prevent a relapse, and that their latter end prove not worse than the beginning, they must needs take up Serpents,</hi> that is, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish poysonous Suggestions;</hi> and so on <hi>Allegorically</hi> with the rest.

               <p>As to shew a match for that. St. <hi>David,</hi> he reporteth,<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 10. c. 8. n. 1, 3.</note> was <hi>one of the greatest Lights that ever the Church enjoyed;</hi> yet was a <hi>Royal Bastard</hi> by a <hi>Nun.</hi> For which I think the <hi>Britains</hi> will con him little thanks.

                  <note place="margin">So also <hi>Capgr. Nov. Legend.</hi> fol. 85.</note> and he bids the Boy that waited on him whom he had raised from the Dead (well offer'd at first dash!) to spread a Napkin under his Feet (a deep My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery!) and whereon standing, to work goes he. In Preaching, <hi>Heaven</hi> sends a <hi>Snow-white Dove</hi> upon his <hi>Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (an hansome Progress!) and <hi>Earth</hi> riseth up under his <hi>Feet,</hi> till it becomes an <hi>Hill,</hi> from whence his Voice was heard like a Trumpet, far and near by all. <hi>Plaudite!</hi> For if this be not a <hi>loud one;</hi> what is so? Either the <hi>Synod</hi> met in a <hi>Church</hi> (the usual place for such Assemblies) and then 'tis ten to one but there was a <hi>Pulpit</hi> or <hi>something</hi> like it, for this Preacher to act his part in: or if it were <hi>abroad,</hi> (which is not to be parallell'd, I suppose) 'twas sure a <hi>Clergy-Army</hi> of <hi>fifteen</hi> or <hi>twenty thousand</hi> that needed a <hi>Hill-Pulpit</hi> to make the <hi>Preacher</hi> heard. And yet, methinks, a <hi>Mountain</hi> is as much too high for those that stand in the <hi>Valley,</hi> as the <hi>Plain</hi> would be too low, for the benefit of hearing. Lastly, for the <hi>Earth</hi> to rise up to a <hi>Mountain</hi> or <hi>Hill,</hi> where <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Mountains</hi> are not scarce before, (as is the case with <hi>Wales,</hi>) and barely for the service of a <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and for one <hi>single Sermon</hi> too, are all, I think, such unlucky Circumstances, as leave the Author more a <hi>Fool</hi> than <hi>Knave,</hi> and <hi>better</hi> worthy of the <hi>Whip</hi> than <hi>Whetstone.</hi>

The <hi>Birds</hi> in two <hi>Armies</hi> divided, assault his <hi>House</hi> with one, his <hi>Cattel</hi> with the other. Back they carry him, and are glad to leave him where they found him.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(3.)"/> Thirdly, <hi>The true end of all true Miracles is, the Glory of God, and eternal good of Men: by a confirmation of that Doctrine that came down from Heaven, to carry thither up again all the sincere embracers of it.</hi> True, miraculous <hi>Cures of Diseases,</hi>

Our Saviour makes this plain by the use he maketh of his <hi>Miracles:</hi> namely, to <hi>convince the People that he came from God with Doctrine that would bring them to him.</hi> The works, (saith he,) <hi>that I do, bear witness that the Father hath sent me, Joh.</hi> 5, 36.

                  <note place="margin">Bellarm. <hi>De Not.

Because no Saintship is, where the <hi>true Faith</hi> is not embraced; and so the Miracle (when 'tis <hi>true,</hi> be sure) looks to the Proof of the Truth of God, and that's the <hi>true end</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>Lastly, And which follows hence, <hi>God never did, doth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(4.)"/> or will work</hi> any Miracles, <hi>mediatly,</hi> or <hi>immediatly to confirm false Doctrine.</hi> Therefore, whatsoever <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Points of Doctrine</hi> contrary to the <hi>Doctrine of God</hi> in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is also so abundantly already confirmed by <hi>great</hi> and <hi>numerous, open</hi> and <hi>unquestionable</hi> Miracles, shall be started; and howsoever they shall be attested, though by the <hi>strangest</hi> and most <hi>amazing Prodigies</hi> or <hi>Wonders</hi> that e're were seen by men; Those <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Points of Doctrine</hi> must be condemned as <hi>Falshoods</hi> and not <hi>Truths,</hi> and those strange <hi>Prodigies</hi> that attest them as <hi>Lying Wonders,</hi> and no <hi>true Miracles.</hi> The reason of both Parts is evident. God is the <hi>God of Truth;</hi> He cannot <hi>lye,</hi> or give his <hi>attestation</hi> to a <hi>falshood.</hi> Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> are his <hi>undoubted Truth:</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:61760:224"/> and whatsoever speaks <hi>against them,</hi> is a <hi>certain Lye;</hi> and therefore <hi>every Wonder</hi> on <hi>its</hi> behalf, <hi>more so.</hi> The <hi>Father of Lyes,</hi> and not the <hi>God of Truth,</hi> must be the <hi>Father</hi> of that <hi>Wonder.</hi> This <hi>Sun</hi> gives sight to very <hi>Moles:</hi> and <hi>blind Papists</hi> cannot avoid conviction hereby.

                  <hi>what is confirmed by a Miracle, is confirmed by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God. But God cannot be the Witness of a Lye.</hi> And therefore works no Miracle against the Scriptures; <hi>which</hi> their <hi>Trent Council</hi> also owns (in ample words at least) to be of God.

                  <hi>it</hi> doth the business <hi>fully</hi> these two ways.

               </p>
               <p>But let the <hi>former,</hi> in the first place,<note place="margin">Which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended but for a time.</note> be consider'd more particularly by us; namely, that <hi>God intended not a Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of Christian Miracles in the Church.</hi> That <hi>extraordinary Officers,</hi> such as <hi>Apostles, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Evangelists,</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed only for the <hi>Churches Infancy,</hi> I know not who doth make a doubt of, as in very deed the <hi>event</hi> is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert an <hi>Infidel.</hi> And wherefore <hi>extraordinary Gifts,</hi> the proper <hi>qualifications</hi> of those <hi>Officers,</hi> and which, if they do not make, to be sure declare them such, should not expire therewith, is not to be imagin'd.

                  <hi>and Knowledge shall vanish away,</hi> he speaketh of these extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts; and if he did not <hi>meerly</hi> intend that <hi>this Cessation of them should fall out in the succeeding Ages of the Church,</hi> yet that his words should have <hi>no respect that way
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61760:225"/> at all,</hi> is not to be admitted. For his saying <hi>Charity never faileth,</hi> must be understood <hi>upon necessity</hi> as meant, <hi>neither in this life, nor that to come.</hi> Therefore, by subjoyning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, that <hi>extraordinary Gifts should fail,</hi> the very nature of the <hi>opposition</hi> doth invite us to understand him, <hi>both in this life and that to come also.</hi> And then <hi>their failing in this life,</hi> cannot respect the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> wherein they most abounded; but must belong to <hi>after Ages</hi> of the Church.

                  <hi>Prophecies shall fail, and Tongues shall cease,</hi> saith thus; <hi>Both being bestowed for the sake of Faith, Faith being spread abroad, their is no further need of either of them. Furthermore, that Prophecies and Tongues should be extinct a good while since</hi> (from the time he wrote in) <hi>is not at all to be wondred at.</hi> So that <hi>Holy, Learned, Ancient Father</hi> both takes St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to intend that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Gifts should be but for a season in the <hi>Church;</hi> and also that so it had fallen out, and long before the time he lived in. But in mine opinion the <hi>Apostle's last words</hi> of the Chapter are plainer yet unto this purpose: <hi>And now abideth Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13.</note>
                  <hi>Hope, and Charity: these three, but the greatest of these is Charity.

Sufficient <hi>Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> that with <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> God ever meant the Case should be far otherwise. And mark this further, that the reason given by the Apostle, why <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> should <hi>cease</hi> and <hi>fail</hi> and <hi>vanish,</hi> understand it, either of the Churches <hi>state Triumphant,</hi> or of <hi>succeeding times</hi> of her <hi>Militant state,</hi> is exceeding fit for <hi>both:</hi> namely, <hi>There is no further need of the things that are so to fail.</hi> Their <hi>office</hi> was <hi>to confirm the Truth of the Gospel.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Reverend Father <hi>Chrysostom</hi> is clear herein. What <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(1.)"/> we have taken notice of in him already goes very far to make this good. But he hath infinitely more.<note place="margin">

In the Churches Infancy, those that believed, wrought Miracles according to that last of</hi> Mark. <hi>Now, that effect of Faith is ceased. Nor yet is Faith idle and vain.</hi> So this <hi>Gentleman</hi> is, I think, as fully and plainly for Miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceased in the Church, as words can speak it. Nor can he be excused with the pretence, that his meaning was, <hi>All that beli ved wrought Miracles then:</hi> and so <hi>that Power is ceased now,</hi> because, <hi>some few only work them at the present.</hi> For this <hi>at once</hi> would load him with the guilt of <hi>gross Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> and <hi>grosser Impiety.</hi> Of <hi>Ignorance:</hi> because it is notorious that but a <hi>few,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29.</note> and by no means <hi>all Believers</hi> were endowed with that Power then.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61760:231"/>
                  <hi>some</hi> wrought Signs. But He, in whose Mouth no guile was found, promis'd it but for <hi>some,</hi> and perform'd it to a Tittle.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>great is Truth,</hi> and will prevail: and sometimes force its <hi>Enemy</hi> to do the office of a <hi>Friend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this time I reckon we may boldly say, Holy Scriptures plainly intimate, sound Reason peremptorily concludes, and great Authors frankly subscribe according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the <hi>Power of working Miracles is long since ceased in the Church,</hi> and then, <hi>no Popish Wonders are true and real Miracles,</hi> to be sure on't.</p>

               <p>Now this <hi>Inhumane Impiety</hi> of <hi>Christians sacrificing their Saviour</hi> unto God, (worse incomparably than the <hi>Jews</hi> making their <hi>Children</hi> to pass through the Fire to <hi>Moloch</hi>) doth sound so monstrously to the ears of <hi>all Men,</hi> (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Cannibals</hi>) much more of <hi>Christians,</hi> that none can doubt but God must needs <hi>abhor</hi> that which <hi>very Nature startles at,</hi> both with <hi>amazement</hi> and <hi>detestation.</hi>

               <p>Besides, indeed their talk is contrary, both to the nature of a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrament</hi> too. A Proper <hi>Sacrifice</hi> requires the Thing be <hi>visible</hi> that is sacrificed, and must <hi>change</hi> it, and so far <hi>destroy</hi> it. <hi>Christ</hi> is the same for ever, cannot be <hi>changed,</hi> nor <hi>destroyed</hi> so, nor do you see Him there; only the shew of Bread is before your eyes. Nay, Christ's <hi>particular Sacrifice</hi> was by <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> nor had it any other <hi>Priest</hi> than <hi>himself.</hi> None of which <hi>are in the Mass.</hi> In the Sacrament, <hi>God offers Christ</hi> once already sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd, and once for all, unto <hi>Man:</hi> in the Mass <hi>Man offers Christ,</hi> and freshly <hi>sacrificeth</hi> him to <hi>God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Further 'tis a Monster of Absurdities.</hi> If the Sacrifice of the Mass be a true proper <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Christ, then Christ is sacrificed more than once, or 10, or 100, or 1000, or 10000, or millions of times; and all it may be in one day too: Then his own Sacrifice of himself was not sufficient. Then he is Sacrific'd, yet not kill'd, destroy'd, nor any way hurt or changed: Then the Sacrifice is utterly unlike it self: Then an External Sacrifice is invisible: <hi>Then</hi> they <hi>unbloudily</hi> pour out <hi>Christ's Blood: Then</hi> a Sinner sacrficeth his Saviour: <hi>Then</hi> he doth worse, put him in his Mouth, grinds him with his Teeth, swallows him into his Belly, and what follows: <hi>Then</hi> he intercedes (which is some kindness) for the Intercessor, for so saith the <hi>Canon of the Mass: Then</hi> Christ being daily offer'd, is daily making n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To conclude, the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> was an utter Stranger hereunto. The Fathers all agree (saith the Learned Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi>) that there was but <hi>One Sacrifice propitiatory for sins,</hi>
